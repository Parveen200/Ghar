 <p>Haryana has emerged through the ravages of times and has still managed to hold on to many of its traditions- some good and some not so good. The people of Haryana strictly adhere to their customs and cultural traditions. Yoga and chanting of Vedic mantras have become an innate part of their lifestyle. The dialect of Haryana, popularly known as Haryanvi, Bangaru or Jatu; is known to be a bit crude but is full of earthy humour and straightforwardness. Most of the people of Haryana have more or less equal social status. The factor of age is a really dominating trait in Haryana, as all elders, whether rich or poor are treated with utmost respect and honour. Thus, it displays a very socialistic nature. In some parts of the state, the economic status of an individual is also determined by the number of cattle he owns! People here tend to retain their racial purity by not allowing marriages in the same gotra. Widow Remarriages are also not encouraged and it is hence a very big obligation to the community.

	Apart from all the vibrant and earthy customs of Haryana, there are a lot of practices here which needs amendment at the earliest. The major among them are the denial of education to the girl child, female infanticide and practice of the purdah.</p>
